# NumGame

A simple console-based number guessing game written in C. This is my first full C project, built after just 4 days of learning C!

## 🎮 Features
- Randomly generates a math problem (addition of two numbers).
- Asks the player to guess the correct answer.
- Provides feedback: Correct or Wrong (and shows the correct answer if wrong).
- ASCII art welcome screen for a fun introduction!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc numgame.c -o numgame
